# GPT-3 Synthetic Data Research Project

This is the repo I used to do my research project on synthetic training data using GPT-3. The repo that created the GPT-3 generated training data can be found [here.](https://github.com/worldwidekatie/GPT3_Synthetic) The repo that created the from-scratch LSTM training data can be found [here.](https://github.com/worldwidekatie/synth_LSTMs)

This repo creates and trains models on that data and saves the results.
