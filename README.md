# GPT-3 Synthetic Data Research Project

This is the repo I used to do my research project on synthetic training data using GPT-3. The repo that created the training data can be found [here](https://github.com/worldwidekatie/GPT3_Synthetic).

This repo creates and trains models on that data and saves the results.
